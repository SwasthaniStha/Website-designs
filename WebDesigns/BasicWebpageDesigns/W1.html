	<blockquote style="font-size:120%;">Born on 17th February,1874 Thomas J Watson is the fifth and only son of his parents. The world renowned salesman started his first sales job at a local hardware store after he left his school. And as a teenager, he worked multiple small unsteady jobs which ended up in loss. Finally after few years, he got as a sales staff and eventually became the general manager of the same company under the guidance of John Henry Peterson who was also his role model. From being in the company and working with Peterson, he started learning multiple business ideas. When the company was struggling to move forward, Watson was assigned to run the business. As expected, he knocked his business competitor and his business started flourishing.<br>After working at NCR for years he joined another company which was called Computing Tabulating Recording Company, famous for its electrical punch cards systems. After working for few years he became the general manager of that company. Later that company grew into what we know today as International Business Company. His tabulating machines made upto 90% in the market in US. With the domination of the market with his products, he wanted to internationally extend his business. Even during the World War he was able to connect his business internationally and maintain foreign relations. A keynote during his international business meeting "World peace through world trade" becama a motto of IBM. He was also known as US President Franklin D. Roosevelt's unofficial ambassador in New York as he was considered Roosevelt's stongest competitor in business community. He was good at maintaining diplomatic and business relations even after post war.  And with his determination and hard work, his company has more than 60,000 employees and over 200 offices through out the country.  </blockquote>
